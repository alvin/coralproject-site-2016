# About us

The Coral Project brings journalists and the communities they serve closer together. 

We do this to raise public trust in journalism, to increase the diversity of voices and experiences reflected in news reporting, and to improve journalism by making it more relevant to people’s lives. Because journalism needs everyone. 

We fulfill this mission through open-source tools and practices for newsrooms of all sizes. Our software is currently in use in more than a dozen newsrooms, with many more coming soon. We also [run events](https://blog.coralproject.net/beyond-comments-our-first-event/), publish [academic research](https://coralproject.net/research.html) and [guides to best practices](https://blog.coralproject.net/), and we share everything we do online, for free. [We can't do it without your help.](https://coralproject.net/contribute.html)

We have three open-source products that you can use:

* [Ask](/products/ask.html) -  a form/gallery builder to collect, manage, and display user-generated contributions. 
* [Talk](/products/talk.html) - a discussion space that is highly customizable, and designed for safety.
* [Guides](/products/guides.html) - methods to improve your online communities, whatever tools you use.

We want to talk to anyone who might be impacted by our work.

So far, we’ve interviewed more than 350 people in 150 newsrooms in 30 countries, as well as commenters, trolls, and people who never comment. [We want to talk to you.](/contact.html)

If you'd like to discuss how we can work together, [please get in touch.](/contact.html)

And the name? Coral’s intricate reef systems protect shorelines and give cover for organisms to connect and evolve. Like coral, we aim to create the structure to help communities thrive.

*The Coral Project was founded as a unique collaboration between the Mozilla Foundation, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, funded by a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Our current funders are The Democracy Fund, the Rita Allen Foundation, and Mozilla.*
