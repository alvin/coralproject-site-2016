# Research

We constantly conduct research as part of our work. If you'd like to work with us, [get in touch.](/contact.html)

##User research

Everything we do is centered around users. We have interviewed more than 300 people from 150 newsrooms in 30 countries. We've talked to frequent commenters, trolls, people who have been harassed out of the comments, and people who never comment. We've brought commenters and college students into newsrooms, and community activists into universities. As a result, we crafted user personas that inform our decisions.

* [Read our User Personas](https://community.coralproject.net/t/our-user-personas/286)
* [See our list of aggregate user needs](https://trello.com/b/Dhrb4D74/coral-s-needs-public) 
â€¢ [Read a study based on commenter interviews](https://blog.coralproject.net/interviews-with-frequent-commenters/) 
* [Visit our online Community where we seek feedback and discussion](https://community.coralproject.net/)


##Events

We host events to inform and improve our work. We also hold workshops and discussions at events around the world.

* [Beyond Comments: Building Better Conversations](https://blog.coralproject.net/beyond-comments-our-first-event/) (held jointly with MIT Media Lab) 
* [Communities of Data](https://blog.coralproject.net/our-first-hackathon/) (held jointly with The Washington Post)
* Dozens of sessions with journalists and editors around the world
* Workshops and discussions with college students in Boston, MA and Washington, DC 

Previous workshops/sessions include:
SRCCON, World Editor's Forum, Online News Association Conference, People-Powered Publishing, Newsgeist, [Association for Alternative News Media](https://blog.coralproject.net/alternative-news-editors-offer-alternatives-to-commenting/), SXSW. 


##Academic studies

We often work with academics to support our work.

* We are funding [the first large-scale qualitative study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/ask-the-post/wp/2016/05/25/survey-what-do-you-think-of-comments-on-the-post/) on commenter behavior on news sites with The Engaging News Project
* Marie Tessier, [a fellow at the Reynolds Journalism Institute at the University of Missiouri](https://www.rjionline.org/projects/marie-tessier-fellowship-project-20152016), conducted [a study of women in comment spaces](https://blog.coralproject.net/raising-womens-voices/) for us 
* We commissioned Nicholas Diakopoulos of the University of Maryland to write [an informal literature review](https://blog.coralproject.net/artificial-moderation-a-reading-list) of academic studies on moderation techniques
* We regularly commission articles from academics and others [for our blog](https://blog.coralproject.net/category/research/)
* We have hosted four Knight-Mozilla OpenNews Fellows [to conduct research and investigations](https://blog.coralproject.net/the-math-behind-the-metrics/) that support our work
* More academic studies to be announced soon

We also assist in the work of several acaedmics and associated studies including [Anika Gupta at MIT](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/104258#files-area), Fiona Martin at University of Sydney, [the World Editors Forum Global Report on Online Commenting](http://www.wan-ifra.org/reports/2016/10/06/the-2016-global-report-on-online-commenting).

##Articles

We commission articles from experts across the fields of community management and software. We are compiling them into [a practical series of guides](https://coralproject.net/products/guides.html) around community and engagement for newsrooms. This has so far included:

* A series on creating and managing communities from the founder of Slashdot
* Interviews with community experts and innovators 
* Shared best practices from community managers at Metafilter, in the health care industry, and more
