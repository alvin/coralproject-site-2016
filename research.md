# Research

We constantly conduct research as part of our work. If you'd like to work with us, let us know. 

##User research

Everything we do is centered around users. We have interviewed more than 320 people from 150 newsrooms in 30 countries. We've talked to frequent commenters, trolls, people who have been harassed out of the comments, and people who never comment. We've brought commenters into newsrooms, and community activists into universities. [We want to talk to you.](/contact.html)

And the name? Coral’s intricate reef systems protect shorelines and give cover for organisms to connect and evolve. Like coral, we aim to create the structure to help communities thrive.
