# Research

We constantly conduct research as part of our work. If you'd like to work with us, [get in touch.](/contact.html)

##User research

Everything we do is centered around users. We have interviewed more than 300 people from 150 newsrooms in 30 countries. We've talked to frequent commenters, trolls, people who have been harassed out of the comments, and people who never comment. We've conducted a survey on journalism and harassment. We've brought commenters and college students into newsrooms, and community activists into universities. As a result, we've crafted user personas and aggregated needs to create our roadmap and inform our decisions.

Resources:

* [Our User Personas](https://community.coralproject.net/t/our-user-personas/286)
* [A list of aggregate user needs](https://trello.com/b/Dhrb4D74/coral-s-needs-public) 
* [A behaviorial study of commenters](https://blog.coralproject.net/interviews-with-frequent-commenters/)

##Academic studies

We work with academics to support our work.

* More academic collaborations to be announced soon

We frequently use [academic studies](https://community.coralproject.net/t/interesting-academic-papers-about-comment-sections) to inform our choices. We have also assisted several academics and associated studies including [Anika Gupta at MIT](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/104258#files-area), Fiona Martin at University of Sydney, [the World Editors Forum Global Report on Online Commenting](http://www.wan-ifra.org/reports/2016/10/06/the-2016-global-report-on-online-commenting).

##Events

We host events to inform and improve our work, by running workshops and discussions around different aspects of what we do. We also hold gatherings in newsrooms, colleges, and at events around the world.
