# For Engagement Editors

## Customise your tools 

No two sites are the same, and your tools need to reflect that. Instead of relying on an opaque generic algorithm, Trust allows you to design your own formulas to identify the best and worst contributions, based on a wide range of context-sensitive data. And because everything we make is open source and designed for expansion, you can add your own features without needing to go through us.

## Scale your workload

By using Trust and Ask together, you can quickly create workflows to make your job much easier. This allows you to focus your work around individual tasks, including encouraging new contributors, keeping specific journalists protected from abuse, and tracking notifications of unusual onsite behavior. We’re also designing our moderation interfaces around simplicity, speed, and increased options to curate content efficiently.

## Find great contributions

Most onsite community resources go into tackling trolls and abuse. By using Trust and Ask, you can better control for negative interactions, allowing you to spend more time finding useful contributions, and sharing them with journalists. You can also give others in your newsroom access to limited versions of the moderation tools, allowing them to reply quickly and easily to positive contributors on their articles. By introducing Ask into your newsroom, you can create more targeted contributor interactions with journalists to directly improve the journalism.
