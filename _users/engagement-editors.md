# For Engagement Editors

## Customise your tools 

No two sites are the same, and your tools need to reflect that. Instead of relying on an opaque generic algorithm, [Trust](/products/trust.html) allows you to design your own formulas to identify the best and worst contributions, based on a wide range of context-sensitive data. And because everything we make is open source and designed for expansion, you can add your own features without needing to go through us.

## Scale your workload

By using [Trust](/products/trust.html) and [Ask](/products/ask.html) together, you can quickly create workflows to make your job easier. This allows you to focus your work around individual tasks, including encouraging new contributors, keeping specific journalists protected from abuse, and tracking notifications of unusual behavior. We’re also designing our [Talk](/products/talk.html) moderation interfaces around simplicity, speed, and increased options to let you curate content efficiently.

## Find great contributions

Most onsite community resources go into tackling trolls and abuse. By using [Trust](/products/trust.html) and [Ask](/products/ask.html), you can better control for negative interactions, allowing you to spend more time finding useful contributions, and sharing them with journalists. By introducing [Ask](/products/ask.html) into your newsroom, you can create more targeted contributor interactions to directly impact the journalism.
