# Guides

Strong community is about more than software. Our guides will help everyone in the newsroom be intentional about their community choices, whatever technology you use.

[Our blog](http://blog.coralproject.net) currently hosts several articles about journalism and community, many of which will be paired with further writing to create our essential series of strategy guides.

*The Coral Projectâ€™s guides to journalism and engagement will be released in Q2 2017.*
