# Ask 

If you want to ask your audience a specific question to improve your reporting, you can give out your email, ask people to use social media or the comments box, or use a third-party form/survey tool.

None of these are built for the needs of journalists. Our Ask tool is.

Better journalism: 
* **Ask encourages more people to respond.** The Gallery feature makes it easy to showcase the best responses, applying the principle of ['Social Proof'](http://www.obanalytics.com/images/Cialdini_2001.pdf) to journalistic practice.
* **Ask allows journalists to tag and search responses to follow up.**<br/>
* **Ask maintains the text of the original submission.** Editors can edit submissions for length, clarity, grammar while saving the original response.<br/>
* **Data visualizations based on submissions are easy to build using the API.** <br/><br/>

Improved design and accessibility:
* **Ask forms are fully compatible across devices.**
* **Ask form designs are fully customizable.** By utilizing a script tag, Ask automatically matches your site design.
* **Ask forms are fully accessible.**<br/><br/>

More efficient response management:
* **Ask contains full Slack integration.** Follow the latest responses in your channel.
* **Ask makes it possible to track respondees across forms.** Find the people who contribute most.
* **Ask includes an easy submissions manager** Quickly filter out abusive or meaningless responses.**<br/><br/>

Stronger user privacy:
