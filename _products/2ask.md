# Ask 

If you want to ask your audience a specific question to improve your reporting, you can give out your email, ask people to use social media or the comments box, or use a third-party form/survey tool.

None of these are built for the needs of journalists. Our Ask tool is. 

[![Ask screenshot]({{"/images/ask_screenshot.png" | prepend:site.baseurl}})](/images/ask_screenshot.png "[IMAGE] A screenshot of the form builder screen of our Ask tool")

It allows you to:

* Invite responses in a compact, embeddable form that's compatible across devices
* Connect contributions to your users' existing on-site identity 
* Build a gallery of the best responses 
* Search and share the best contributions 
* Keep complete control of your data

By combining Ask with Trust and Talk, you can easily identify the best people to respond, and send them your questions in just a few clicks.

*Ask will launch in an open beta at the end of August 2016.*
