# Ask 

If you want to ask your audience a specific question to improve your reporting, you can give out your email, ask people to use social media or the comments box, or use a third-party form/survey tool.

None of these are built for the needs of journalists. Our Ask tool is.

Better journalism: 
* **Ask encourages more people to respond to your form.** The Gallery feature makes it easy to showcase the best responses, applying the psychological principle of ['Social Proof'](http://www.obanalytics.com/images/Cialdini_2001.pdf) to journalistic practice.
* **Ask allows journalists to tag and search responses to follow up.**<br/>
* **Ask maintains the text of the original submission.** Editors can edit submissions for length, clarity, grammar while maintaining the reader's original response.<br/>
* **Data visualizations based on submissions are easy to build using the API.** <br/><br/>

Improved design and accessibility:
* **Ask forms are fully compatible across devices.**
* **Ask form designs are fully customizable.** By utilizing a script tag, Ask automatically matches your site design.
* **Ask forms are fully accessible.**<br/><br/>

More efficient response management:
* **Ask contains full Slack integration**
* **Ask makes it possible to track respondees across forms.**
* **The Ask submissions manager makes it easy to filter out abusive or meaningless responses, and to share the most helpful contributions.**<br/><br/>

Stronger user privacy: 
* **Ask doesn't share user data with anyone.** <br/><br/>

Ask is also open source and fully customizable. You own your install of Ask, and can optimize it for your needs.
By combining Ask with Trust and Talk, you will be able to easily identify the best people to respond, and send them your questions in just a few clicks.
