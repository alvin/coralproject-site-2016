# Talk 

Online comments are broken. Our Talk tool rethinks how moderation, comment display, and conversation function, creating the opportunity for safer, smarter discussions around your work.

![Talk Moderation]({{"/images/talk_mod2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl}})

To design Talk, we’ve done [an enormous amount of research](https://coralproject.net/research.html) into the design and function of online comment spaces, and how they can better connect with journalism. 

We’ve created a streamlined system that can improve how people behave and interact in the comments space, and allow moderators to more easily identify and remove disruptive comments.

Talk is lightweight, secure, flexible, and responsive. It’s also fully extensible with a RESTful and Graph API and a plugin architecture that includes webhooks. 

We’ve designed it to help publishers of all sizes host and manage conversations on their sites. And like everything we make, it’s 100% open source.
