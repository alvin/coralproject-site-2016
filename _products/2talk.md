# Talk 

Talk is now live on [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2017/09/06/the-washington-post-launches-talk-commenting-platform/), [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-wsj-commenting-experiment-1510164431), and [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2017/12/18/comments-coral-project/) among many other sites.

Online comments are broken. Our open source Talk tool rethinks how moderation, comment display, and conversation function, creating the opportunity for safer, smarter discussions around your work.


**What makes Talk different?**

Everything in Talk is based on [our ongoing research](https://coralproject.net/research.html) into healthy online communities. It's based on [a clear vision to improve engagement online.](https://blog.coralproject.net/our-goals-for-talk/)

Just as with our other tool [Ask](https://coralproject.net/products/ask.html), Talk is open source, decentralized, and free to use.

For Moderators:

![Talk Comment Moderation]({{"/images//talk/talk_comment_mod.png" | prepend: site.baseurl}})

* **Feature the best comments.** Highlight the best contributions to encourage quality submissions.
* **Contextual reports.** Learn from your community about the biggest problems.
* **Keyboard shortcuts.** Moderate quickly without having to move your mouse.
* **Detailed commenter history.** View all their comments, rejected comments, when they joined, their contact information, and see a history of moderator actions. 
* **Take bulk actions on comments.** Someone spamming across your site? Remove all their submissions in a couple of clicks.
* **Suspend commenters to give them a ‘time out.’** Not everyone should be banned for life. Suspensions are temporary and automatically expire.
* **Commenter karma scores.** If someone starts to behave badly, their comments automatically switch to pre-moderation until they improve.
* **[Toxic Comments plugin](https://blog.coralproject.net/toxic-avenging/) developed with Google Jigsaw.** Use machine learning to detect problematic behavior.
* **In-article moderation.** Take action as you read.

![Talk Article Moderation]({{"/images/talk/talk_mod_actions.png" :class="img-responsive" | prepend: site.baseurl}})

* **Moderate from [inside a Slack channel.](https://blog.coralproject.net/slacking-on/)** Take action and track new comments from within your existing workflow.
* **Set single articles to pre-moderation.** Some topics are harder than ours. Our system lets you treat them that way.
* **Banned and Suspect word identification.** Instantly reject the worst comments, and keep an eye on other tricky words and phrases.
* **Search by article title or author.** Quickly find comment streams to moderate.
* **Display clear behavioral guidelines.** Set the tone and establish the rules of the road.
* **Automatically close comments after a set period.** 
* …and much more

For Commenters:

![Talk Ignore]({{"/images/talk/talk_ignore.png" | prepend: site.baseurl}})

* **Mute individual commenters.** Ignore the voices that you find annoying.
* **Hide off-topic comments.** Talk about other things, and let others choose if they want to see it.
* **See your comment history, including Likes/Replies.** 
* **Sort comments by most replied/most liked/oldest/newest.** Read the comments, your way.
* **Multi-threading for easier reading.** Follow the conversation as it unfolds.
* **Staff badges identify journalists' replies.**
* **Link to a single discussion.** Share the link and watch the conversation in real time.
* **Instant updates.** No need to refresh to see the latest comments.

* **Own and manage all the data.** Nobody else should have access your users' data. 
* **Designed to manage high traffic volume.** Battle tested on some of the web's most visited news sites.
* **Match your Talk install to your site design.** They're your comments, so they should look like they belong on your site.
* **Connect to your existing Single Sign-On or use our decentralized auth system.** Users should only have to log in once.
* **Grant subscribers special commenter badges.** Reward those users who pay - and encourage others to join them.
