# Talk 

Publishers using Talk include [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2017/09/06/the-washington-post-launches-talk-commenting-platform/), [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-wsj-commenting-experiment-1510164431), [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2017/12/18/comments-coral-project/), [IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/a-fresh-start-for-ign-comments), and several local newsrooms including [Register-Guard](http://registerguard.com/rg/opinion/36262277-78/new-commenting-system-faq.html.csp), [Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/opinions/2017/12/20/were-launching-a-new-system-for-online-reader-comments/), and the [Voice of San Diego](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/).

Online comments are broken. Our Talk tool rethinks how moderation, comment display, and online conversation function, creating the opportunity for safer, smarter discussions around your work.

**What makes Talk different?**

Everything in Talk is based on [our ongoing research](https://coralproject.net/research.html) into healthy online communities. It's based on [a clear vision to improve engagement online.](https://blog.coralproject.net/our-goals-for-talk/)

Just as with our other tool [Ask](https://coralproject.net/products/ask.html), Talk is open source, decentralized, and free to use. [You can read more about the benefits of open source software here.](https://www.zivtech.com/blog/benefits-open-source-software)
