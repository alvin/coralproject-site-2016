# Talk 

Online comments are broken. Our Talk tool rethinks how moderation, comment display, and conversation function, creating the opportunity for safer, smarter discussions around your work.

[Talk is now live on The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2017/09/06/the-washington-post-launches-talk-commenting-platform/)

![Talk Moderation]({{"/images/talk_mod2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl}})

To create Talk, we’ve carried out [an enormous amount of research](https://coralproject.net/research.html) into the design and function of online comment spaces, and how they can better connect with the work of journalists. 

We’ve built a streamlined system that can improve how people behave and interact in the comments space, and allow moderators to more easily identify and remove disruptive comments.

Talk is lightweight, secure, flexible, and responsive. It’s also fully extensible with a RESTful and Graph API and a plugin architecture that includes webhooks. 

We’ve designed it to help publishers of all sizes host and manage conversations on their sites in whatever ways that they want to do it. And like everything we make, only you own your data, and our code is 100% open source.
