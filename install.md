# How to Install

To run our products, you need to install them on your own server.

[You can find all of our technical documentation here](http://docs.coralproject.net).

If you need assistance, please email our [Jeff Nelson, our Integration Engineer.](mailto:jeff@mozillafoundation.org)

We do not currently offer a hosted/license and delivery service. If you're interested in such a service for your newsroom, please [email jeff@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:jeff@mozillafoundation.org) and we'll be in touch when we have more news.
